# Logic Games AI Project

A Python-based project for turn-based logic games with built-in AI agents and real-time gameplay. The system supports multiple games with full rule logic, AI strategies, and simple user interfaces. Itâ€™s built to allow AI vs AI matches, real-time execution, and easy extension with new games or strategies.

## Features

- Multiple board games with complete move logic and rule handling
- AI agents using MinMax and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Real-time gameplay via an internal API
- Modular design for adding games or AI strategies
- Unit tests for key components

## Purpose
The project serves as a practical exploration of AI in structured, competitive environments. It allows users to study how different decision-making algorithms perform in various strategic contexts.
